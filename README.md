# 3D Model Visualizer

This is a wireframe 3D model visualizer using [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools) for an university project in Computer Graphics class.

The main goal of the project is not to do the most efficient visualizer, but to understand the basics of computer graphics 
(such as displaying objects on screen, transformations and lighting), 
to get a better experience by having a deeper view of the subject 
and diving in a lesser abstract tool like [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org).
